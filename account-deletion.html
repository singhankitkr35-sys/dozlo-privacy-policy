    <h1>Dozlo — Account Deletion</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 29, 2025</p>

    <p class="note">
      If you would like your Dozlo account and associated personal data permanently removed, please follow the instructions below.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>To request deletion of your Dozlo account, send an email to:</p>
    <p><strong><a href="mailto:singhankitkr35@gmail.com">singhankitkr35@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
    <p>
      Please use the subject line: <strong>Delete My Dozlo Account</strong> and include the following information in your message:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Google email address you used to sign in to Dozlo (required).</li>
      <li>Any other identifiers you used in the app (optional).</li>
      <li>A short confirmation that you understand deletion is permanent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Will Delete</h2>
    <p>
      When we process your deletion request, we will permanently remove the following personal data associated with your account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account identifier (Google account ID used for Sign-In).</li>
      <li>Name and email address stored for your profile.</li>
      <li>Listening history and playback analytics tied to your account.</li>
      <li>Profile preferences and user-specific personalization data.</li>
      <li>Any user-uploaded content (if applicable) tied to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We May Retain</h2>
    <p>Some information may be retained in limited, non-identifying forms or for legal reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregated or anonymized analytics that cannot be used to identify you (used for service improvement).</li>
      <li>Records required for legal compliance, fraud prevention, or dispute resolution (kept only as long as legally necessary).</li>
      <li>Backups where deletion will be applied according to our backup retention schedule; these are removed as soon as practical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deletion Timeline</h2>
    <p>
      After we receive your deletion request email and verify the account details, we will process your request within
      <strong>8–10 calendar days</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will receive an acknowledgement email when your request is received and a follow-up confirmation email once deletion is complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Verification &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>
      To protect your privacy and prevent unauthorized deletion requests, we may ask you to confirm the Google email address
      used with the Dozlo account or to reply from that same email address. We will never ask for your password.
    </p>

    <h2>Need Help?</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about the deletion process or need assistance, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:singhankitkr35@gmail.com">singhankitkr35@gmail.com</a>. We aim to respond to all deletion requests and questions promptly.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Deleting your Dozlo account is permanent and cannot be undone. If you later create a new account,
      past listening history and personalization that was deleted will not be recoverable.
